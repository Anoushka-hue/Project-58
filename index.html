  <p>My hobby is reading fiction books like Harry Potter.In my free time after my work I like to read books.I am 11 years old I read in 7th standard.Now I know very well that reading is a very good habit which can make me complete.This great hobby can be developed by anyone though I have it naturally. Reading books can keep anybody occupied and happy.Of course this only happens if we read the genre of book we want.I like fiction books while you may not.It is the good source of knowledge(depend on which books you are reading),enjoyment,imspiration and instruction.It makes us disciplined,loyal,punctual and most importantly a successfull person in life.</p>
